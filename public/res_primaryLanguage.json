    "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rhett Beardemphl, some things I enjoy about development are the challenging puzzles and creative thinking that it presents me with everyday. Never a dull moment as they say. When I get a breakthrough to occur it's an awesome and rewarding experience that drives me forward. My core skills come from having previously worked on and managed teams. This motivates me to find an ideal environment where everyone on the team supports and teaches each other to grow and become better at our craft. An environment like this would help me reach both of my goals. One of which is to become a specialized and skillful individual who is a needed piece of company and/or project. And the other is to continually grow and get better as a person and developer.",
